jQuery UI Scrollable
====================

A jQuery UI widget that enables monitoring, querying, or changing the scroll position of an element relative to 
a scrolling  container.  Read about the journey to get here on 
my blog post - [benknowscode.com/2013/07/detect-dom-element-scrolled-with-jquery](http://www.benknowscode.com/2013/07/detect-dom-element-scrolled-with-jquery.html)

- **Detect**: Monitors whether target elements scroll in/out of the visible view of a scroll container (not just the window).
Allows configuring a logical size of the container to affect where the target must actually be located before triggering events.
- **Query**: Provides location information identifying where the target element is located relative to the container (top, left, bottom, right).
- **Change**: Enables animated scrolling of the target into the container with any of the built-in jQuery easing options and flexible
positioning settings.
